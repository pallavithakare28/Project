# Project
Participated in MLH Neighborhood Hack


## Inspiration
It may happen many times when your vehicle fails on the highway, street or even fuel tank gets empty. In third-world countries like India, it is difficult to get the Service at that time. Even the Person doesn't know from where he'll get the Garage or Mechanic or Petrol Pump. 
In the Pandemic situation of COVID-19, I observed and tried to solve the problem of my neighbor who is a Mechanic.  I was keen to provide something to society and for its betterment develop something by applying my knowledge of technology.

## What it does
This project reduces a lot of human effort and makes the right use of technology. In this project, both Customers and Service Providers can register themselves on this portal. When the Customer needs help, he/she can go through the website and check for the availability of Mechanic as well as Petrol Pump nearby them. This project helps to get the Service as soon as possible. 
The customer can contact them and share their Location with the Mechanic via message/WhatsApp. So the mechanic can reach there within time. 

## How I built it
I have made the FrontEnd using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. More information is given in my readme file (Github).

## Challenges I ran into
Details about different categories.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of making a solution that helps to make their business presence, as well as Customer, can get their help nearby them. 

## What we learned
I learned about responsive images, Google Maps, and how they can be added to the HTML page. I was also able to explore various other ways to make website content user-friendly.

## What's next for MechanicOnline
In the future, I will try to make a database connection for customers and Service providers. And also will try to add spare part details and needs to categories them according to areas.
